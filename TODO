Outreaching:
  Documentation:
    ☐ In the documentation, show how to create a custom operator (maybe a Xor/⊻/⊕) starting from scratch.
  README:
    ✔ Check examples (see NOTE or pluto-demo.jl) @done(23-09-05 19:34)
    ✔ List of similar packages @done(23-09-05 19:30)
    ☐ Highlight SoleLogics use cases

Readibility: 
  ✔ Write check's docstring @done(23-09-05 19:33)
  ☐ Rename things to increase readability, using @deprecate in a deprecate.jl file.

Tests:
  ✔ Fix SatsBase.sample errors @done(23-09-05 19:36)

Utilities:
  ✔ Differentiate Base.rand and StatsBase.sample (randformula should have a picker::Function argument, which can be rand or sample) @done(23-09-05 19:36)
  ✔ @atoms defaulted to String @done(23-09-12 15:48)

From PAndQ:
  ✔ Write the algorithm that produces truth tables of propositional formulae @done(23-09-05 19:36)
  ☐ Recognize if a formula is satisfiable, is a contingency, a tautology or a contraddiction.
  ✔ Macro to easily create atoms and parse expressions related to syntax (See PAndQ.jl) @done(23-09-05 19:36)

General:
  ☐ Write random models generation (see pluto-demo.jl)

  Normalization:
    ☐ Add custom normalization rules to normalize
    ☐ Simplify code when possible, using dual/hasdual traits

  Interpretations:
    ☐ Create a SupportedInterpretation
    ☐ Algorithm to generate a truth table
