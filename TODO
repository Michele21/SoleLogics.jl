□ Regroup Worlds and Relations in Ontologies.
□ Move `Ontology` from ModalDecisionTrees.

□ Think about the differences between SoleData and SoleLogics
    SoleLogics will contain `NamedLetter`, that is, a concrete struct of
    `AbstractLetter` who only wraps an Union{String,Symbol}.
    Also, `check` dispatch in SoleLogics will only refer Kripke Models ("graph data") and `NamedLetter`s.

    Everything that regards data, will be moved to SoleData.
    For example, `a1 ⋈ f(A) ⋈ a2` will be defined in SoleData as `DimensionalCondition`. 

    SoleLearning will overload SoleLogics' `check` dispatch and actually
    work with the definitions in SoleLogics (e.g worlds, relations) on
    real data (SoleBase, SoleData's `DimensionalCondition`).

□ Look for github Tags. 
    Resolve OVERLAY2022's repo dependencies, targetting specific branches of
    SoleModelChecking (mfmm), SoleLogics (overlay2022), SoleWorlds (worlds/mauro), SoleAlphabet (dev), SoleTraits (dev).
