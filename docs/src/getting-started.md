## [Syntax Basics](@id syntactical-base-definitions)

Logical formulas are syntactical objects representing statements which level of truth can be assessed.
Formulas arise from formal grammars (e.g., context-free grammars), and are most commonly represented as syntax trees.
At the leaf nodes of a syntax tree are atoms (simple, atomic statements) or truth values (e.g., ‚ä§, representing truth),
while at the internal nodes are logical connectives that allow for the composition of formulas to represent complex concepts.

In SoleLogics, an Atom is a wrapper for any value (accessible via the `value` method).
