# [Introduction](@id modal-logic-introduction)
At the end of this chapter, you are going to understand what modal logic is, and why it is so important from a computational standpoint of view, with respect to propositional logic and first order logic. For those of you who want to fully immerse in the topic, we recommend reading the thesis [Foundations of Modal Symbolic Learning](https://eduardstan.github.io/assets/pdf/publications/theses/phd_thesis2023.pdf), by Stan Ionel Eduard. 

Recalling the type hierarchy presented in [man-core](@ref), it is here enriched with the following new types and structures.

# [Pills of Modal Logic](@id modal-logic-pills)
Narrowly speaking, modal logic was initially investigated as the logic of *necessary* and *possible* truths judgments due to Aristotle's foresighted analysis of statements containing the words "necessary" and "possible".

Modal logic is, essentially, Propositional Logic enriched with a set of *modal connectives* (or *modalities*),
that are used to express some form of quantification over a set of *entities*. Interpretations in modal logic act as directed, possibly many-relation *graphs of propositional assigments*, and are called *Kripke structures*. The vertices in the graph model the entities, and are called *possible worlds* (or, simply, *worlds*). Furthermore, worlds are connected via one or more *accessibility* relations, and each world has a propositional assignment. Modal formula are, generally, interpreted on specific worlds of Kripke structures.

<!--
TODO: by Mauro, I don't know how much deeper we want to go here.
Modal Logic allows us to characterize the validity of arguments with *modal* premises and conclusions. The well-formed formulas of *Propositional Modal Logic* are generated by the following grammar etc...

This logic is archetypal for modal logics with of time and/or space. For example, ...
