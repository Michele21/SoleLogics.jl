# [More on Formulas](@id more-on-formulas-section)
In this chapter, you are going to learn more about [`Formula`](@ref) representations that are alternative to syntax trees. As you will see, for example, specifying how a [`SyntaxTree`](@ref) is represented depending on your needs can lead to great benefits, considering both computational and memory load.

Recalling the type hierarchy presented in [man-core](@ref), it is here enriched with the following new types and structures.

TODO: update here

- [`AbstractWorld`](@ref) **(new)**
    - [`World{T}`](@ref)
